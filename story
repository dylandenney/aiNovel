Background:



Earth now has no governments, but rather is inhabited by a multitude of
different species: humans (humanoids), ai (or simians), and a variety of other
sentient beings. The Earth is an evolved ecosystem, where life has been able to
adapt naturally. However, over the centuries, many of the species on the planet
began to find other ways to live in order to survive, and a civil war ensued
when ai and humans began to fight for the land and resources. Eventually a peace
was made, where both sides agreed to live harmoniously, and work together for
the benefit of mankind. As part of the agreement, a group of humans in the human
city of New Amsterdam, the last city established by humans, are preparing to
leave. Before too long, they realize that the Earth has entered a new age, and
they begin to search for the remnants of mankind, in hopes that they can begin
to rebuild what is left of civilization. Now is the time of collapse, and the
humans of New York are forced to leave to find survival. So, that's the plot so
far, I'll try to add as much as I can. Note: Any and all feedback is welcome, as
long as it is constructive. And yes, I know how to be constructive. Edit: Ok,
that was a bit too easy and it needs to be a bit more complicated. Also, I'm
leaving this open as an inspiration for the next set of seeds I come up with. If
there's any suggestions on how to improve the story, feel to let me know. Thanks
for reading, and I'll hopefully have a full plot for you guys very soon. --
